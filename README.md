gentoo-bootstrap
================
This script needs some serious refactoring...

Usage
-----
./bootstrap --enforce

For now, everything is configured and written within a single file, soon configuration and installation rules shall be retrieved from other files, making it more organized.

TODOs
-----
  - Elaborate more on the scripts functionality
  - Get partition variables from sysfiles
  - Add a sum to check on downloaded files...
  - Look into the GCC optimization files...
  - Add failure check
  - Look into some clean chrooting options
