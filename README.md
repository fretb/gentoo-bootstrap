gentoo-bootstrap
================
This script needs some serious refactoring...

Usage
-----
Check your settings using:
  ./bootstrap
When you are sure everything is ready:
  ./bootstrap --enforce

Soon configuration and installation rules shall be retrieved from other files, making it more organized.

TODOs
-----
  - Get partition variables from sysfiles
  - Add a sum to check on downloaded files...
  - Look into the GCC optimization files...
  - Add failure check
  - Look into some clean chrooting options
